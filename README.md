## What I Learned
* How to use the nltk library to download the punkt package that uses a algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences.
* How to use Newspaper3k library for extracting & curating articles.
* How to use sklearn count vector to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts and cosine_similarity to shift through the extracted article to look for similarity between the desired info and the article
